## üßæ Introduction

This report reflects on the development process and learning experience associated with the ‚ÄúData Science Data Manager‚Äù project developed for CW1. The project involved building a modular, Java-based tool that could load, transform, analyze, and export structured data (CSV files), while incorporating three key object-oriented design patterns: Singleton, Factory, and Observer.

## üõ†Ô∏è Design Patterns Used

### 1. Singleton Pattern

- **Class:** `DataManager`
- **Purpose:** Ensures a single shared instance of the dataset manager, maintaining consistent state and global configuration throughout the program.
- **Reflection:** Implementing Singleton taught me how to control access to shared resources in a multicomponent system.

### 2. Factory Pattern

- **Class:** `TransformerFactory`
- **Purpose:** Dynamically creates filter operations (e.g., filter greater than, filter equals) based on input parameters.
- **Reflection:** Using Factory helped separate object creation from logic, which made it easier to scale and test.

### 3. Observer Pattern

- **Classes:** `Observer`, `ConsoleObserver`
- **Purpose:** Enables the system to notify observers when the dataset is updated (e.g., after filtering or import).
- **Reflection:** This pattern improved decoupling and made real-time feedback (via console updates) possible.

## üöß Challenges Faced

- Designing a reusable and modular architecture while also ensuring that it remained testable.
- Managing exceptions and validation when importing malformed CSV files.
- Implementing correct statistical logic for mean, median, and standard deviation.
- Ensuring separation of concerns among IO, core logic, and transformation components.

## üí° Learning Reflection

This project significantly enhanced my understanding of object-oriented design and how abstract design principles are implemented in real systems. Prior to this coursework, I had only basic familiarity with design patterns. Now I feel confident using them to build more maintainable and scalable applications.

I also learned how to write unit tests using JUnit, which gave me a new appreciation for the importance of testing and debugging in software development.

## ü§ñ Use of AI Tools

I used AI (ChatGPT) in a limited and ethical way‚Äîprimarily to clarify programming concepts, validate logic, and double-check my understanding of design pattern structures. I did **not** use AI to write the full code or report.

All submitted code is fully written and tested by myself.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical and Legal Considerations

- **Plagiarism Awareness:** I ensured that all code was my own or adapted with clear understanding from permitted sources.
- **Data Handling:** I used only mock data (`sample.csv`) to avoid any privacy issues.
- **Tool Usage:** AI was used in accordance with university guidance. No prohibited auto-generation was used in the final report or source code.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project offered a practical opportunity to reinforce object-oriented programming skills and software design principles. I improved my technical ability, design thinking, and problem-solving skills. The use of patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer greatly influenced my approach to building maintainable Java software.
